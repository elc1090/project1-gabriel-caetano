      <h1>The Best PS5 Games</h1>
      <p>The PS5 capped off February 2023 with the release of the PSVR2, giving players a whole new console VR gaming experience with enhanced graphics and a wider 110-degree field of view, plus Horizon Call of the Mountain – if they got the bundle. The PSVR2 library may be small now, but Sony’s latest State of Play presentation announced five games are coming to the headset this year, including The Foglands, Green Hell, Synapse, Journey to Foundation, and Before Your Eyes. On the console side, we got the cinematic trailer for Destiny 2: Lightfall, extended gameplay footage from Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, and the announcement that Tchia will launch on PlayStation Plus’ Extra and Premium tiers on March 21. While we wait for those games, here are the 5 best PS5 games you can play now.

Our list is updated to feature all PS5 games — no more PS4 backward-compatible games. Our main qualifier now is that, given how many cross-gen games there are, games on this list have to have a dedicated next-gen version available.

Some games make excellent use of the DualSense controller’s innovative haptic feedback, others will make your gaming TV shine with 4K gameplay, and some are just plain great games. Without further ado, here are our updated picks for the 5 best PS5 games.</p>

        <h2>5. Demon's Souls</h2>
        <figure>

        <p>Bluepoint Games had some high expectations to meet with the PS5 remake of Demon’s Souls. Not only was it an anticipated remake of a beloved and landmark game, but also as the first major showcase of what a dedicated PS5 game of this scope could look like.

          Fortunately, Bluepoint delivered, and Demon’s Souls is not only jaw-droppingly gorgeous, but it’s also incredibly faithful to the source material.It's handily one of the deepest, richest, and most challenging experiences currently found on the console.
          
          Developer Bluepoint Games was officially acquired by PlayStation in 2021. The studio's next project will be an original game, rather than another remake.</p>

        <h2>4. Spider-Man: Miles Morales</h2>
        <figure>
        <img src="./assets/game-4.jpg" alt="imagem do jogo Spider-Man: Miles Morales">
        <figcaption>Está é uma imagem do jogo Spider-Man: Miles Morales</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Though not a full-blown sequel, this standalone expansion sends Peter Parker on vacation and leaves his young spider-apprentice Miles Morales to look after New York. Building on the rock-solid foundations of Insomniac's first game, New York has been gorgeously blanketed with snow, holiday cheer, and next-gen polish.

          The improvements aren't just cosmetic, however – the eponymous hero has a few more spider-powers at his disposal than Peter Parker, and these are cleverly adapted into new gameplay mechanics that, while they don't reinvent the wheel, they put enough of a spin on it to make it feel fresh - sometimes literally, thanks to the DualSense controller. It doesn't feature as robust of a campaign or as many colorful villains as 2018's Spider-Man, but Miles Morales' story has just as much charm and heart as its predecessor, possibly more. Its tagline of "Be Greater" set a high bar, but Miles Morales somersaults over it with ease.
          
          And if you're loving Miles Morales but somehow missed out on or want to replay its predecessor, there's no reason not to get the ultimate edition and pick up Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered as well. We previously had MSMR as a standalone game on this list because it was such a great port, but considering the breadth of games we want to now highlight on the PS5, and its availability only as a part of Miles' special edition, we decided to couple it with our recommendation here.
          
          Insomniac is now working on two Marvel projects: Spider-Man 2 and a Wolverine game.</p>

        <h2>3. The Last of Us Part 1</h2>
        <figure>
        <img src="./assets/game-3.jpg" alt="imagem do jogo The last of Us Part 1">
        <figcaption>Está é uma imagem do jogo The last of Us Part 1</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The Last of Us Part I is arguably the best way to experience the story Naughty Dog was initially told back in 2013. While there is a point of contention on whether this remake was necessary overall, the improvements and changes introduced are enough to warrant this as a great first way to experience this decade-old franchise. The improved character models and facial animation are the biggest praises for this remake, making the phenomenal acting done by the cast more meaningful and realistic. The Last of Us has an incredible and emotional story, and the updated technology allows even the most touching scenes to hit the closest to home. The utilization of the PS5's DualSense controller also greatly improves the core gameplay and is some of the best showcases of what the controller is capable of to date. The haptic feedback you can feel in every weapon used, from melee to firearms, and the fact that environmental effects such as the sensation of falling rain helo immerse you into this ravaged and desolated world. Not only that, but the DualSense features also have been a great tool in accessibility, using the controller's haptic feedback to allow players to feel everything they encounter, whether through physical interaction or hearing it, such as in dialogue exchanges.

          While the remake does not include the multiplayer mode found in 2013 original, and the remastered version was ported just a year later, we know that Naughty Dog is working on a standalone multiplayer game set in The Last of Us universe.</p>

        <h2>2. God of War Ragnorok</h2>
        <figure>
        <img src="./assets/game-2.jpg" alt="imagem do jogo God of War Ragnarok">
        <figcaption>Está é uma imagem do jogo God of War Ragnarok</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>God of War Ragnarok is hands down one of the easiest games to recommend to anyone asking what game they should play first on their PS5. The gameplay is an immensely satisfying combination of combat, puzzle solving, and exploration that is bound together with a heartwarming story of family, adolescence, and letting go. The combat rewards players for experimentation and precision but also is versatile enough that even using a fraction of the moves at your disposal feels effective and rewarding. Each moment is bolstered by its fantastic soundtrack that elevates everything from the smallest interaction to the most impactful moments in the story. The world's jaw-dropping landscapes feel organic and filled with life (except for Helheim, of course), but it's hard not to stop and admire it every step.

          Its story, gameplay, soundtrack, and nearly every other part of the game culminate masterfully to live up to expectations for a flagship PlayStation game. Some may take issue with the pacing in certain parts of the game, but the next chapter in Kratos and Atreus's saga is filled with heart, charm, and humor. With the combination of the improvements from God of War (2018) and the path it's carved out for itself among other action-adventure games, God of War: Ragnarok is one of the new benchmarks for what Playstation exclusives can do on the PS5.</p>

      <div class="game-description" id="GAME1">
        <h2>1. Elden Ring</h2>
        <figure>
        <img src="./assets/game-1.jpg" alt="imagem do jogo Elden Ring">
        <figcaption>Está é uma imagem do jogo Elden Ring</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>It’s hard to encapsulate everything that makes Elden Ring such a monumental game in a short blurb, but let’s try: at the core of it all is Elden Ring’s incredible sense of freedom and discovery. There are open world games that are bigger than Elden Ring, prettier than Elden Ring, and quite frankly run better than Elden Ring, but few, if any, are as robust or as rewarding.

          The Lands Between is positively littered with branching paths that lead to catacombs, dungeons, caves, forts, castles, towers, even entire underground cities, and within each of them is some sort of unique challenge, from a trap filled crypt with insta-kill chariots racing down every slope, to one of Elden Ring's many fantastic boss fights. The best part of it all is that every challenge comes with its own bountiful reward that may bend the difficulty curve in your favor, whether that’s a new spell, summon, weapon, or material that lets you upgrade your gear. Elden Ring can be an extraordinarily difficult game, sure, but the freedom it gives you to maneuver through or around that difficulty is absolutely liberating, and makes it the most universally recommendable From Software game yet.
          
          Elden Ring is one of the best-reviewed games in modern history. It was crowned Game of the Year by IGN and The Game Awards.</p>
